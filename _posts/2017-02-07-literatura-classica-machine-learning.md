Aqui vale fazer uma consideração: Temos a seguir uma listagem separada sobre Deep Learning. Isso se deve por essa ser uma técnica de Machine Learning que diz respeito a oportunidade de aprendizagem profunda com o uso de redes neurais.

Em momento oportuno devo vou compartilhar aqui mais informações sobre Deep Learning, como meus estudos, códigos e referências. Por hora, segue a bibliografia melhor avaliada sobre o tema.
